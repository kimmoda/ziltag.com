<h1>Privacy Policy <small>September, 2015</small></h1>
<hr>

<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to watch videos and view photos, to communicate with other people, to buy commodities, to obtain information, or to create new content. The information you share with us, for example when creating a Ziltag Account, can help us make those services better. As you use our services, we would like you to be well informed on how we are using the information and various measures in which you can protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What type of information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
  <li>How we use that information.</li>
  <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
  <li>Rights derived from your personal information.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you are not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, please read the definition of these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Ziltag so whether you are new to Ziltag or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and contact us at our customer service line or email us at service@ziltag.com if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<hr>

<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you use, to more complex things such as which ads you will find most useful, preferences and rewards.</p>

<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Information you give us.</b> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Ziltag Account. When you do, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, gender, telephone number or credit card number. </li>
  <li>
    <b>Information we collect from your use of our services.</b> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, such as when you watch videos on Ziltag or when you view our ads and interact with the content. This information may include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Device information</b></p>
        <p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Ziltag may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Ziltag Account.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Log information</b></p>
        <p>When you use our services or view content provided by Ziltag, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>details of how you have used our services, such as your search queries.</li>
          <li>telephone log information like your phone number, number of incoming calls, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</li>
          <li>Internet protocol address.</li>
          <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
          <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Ziltag Account.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Location information</b></p>
        <p>When you use a location-enabled Ziltag service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine your location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Unique application numbers</b></p>
        <p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Ziltag when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically connect with our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Local storage</b></p>
        <p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</b></p>
        <p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Ziltag service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Ziltag features that may appear on other sites.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
