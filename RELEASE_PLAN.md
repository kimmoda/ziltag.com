# Ziltag Release Plan
There are two commit points in current plan, one is the alpha version to win the trust of our investor, should be committed at the middle of Oct. Another is the beta version which will launch to the early adopters, should do all things well.

## Landing Page
The landing page's target audience is the content provider, we should urge the target audience to make a trial of our work.

The release plan of landing page factor into two parts.

### Show to Early Adopters:
The landing page will consist of a video, an invitation wording, a form of registration, an about us page and the script installation manual.

### Launch to the World:
Based on the previous art and plus the gallery of early adopters.

The commit point of the landing page can be deferred after the alpha.

The design of landing page is still not confirmed.

## Registration Process
The registration process is divided into two kind of users, one of the content providers, another of the end users. The registration process should be minimized as short as possible.

### Registration of Content Provider
The content provider visits our landing page, watching our elaborate introduction video, reading a motivational introduction and call to registration by a field for email and a submit button. To make the content provider more convinced, above process will plus a galley before the call to action phase when we get early adopters.

The content provider is redirected to the script installation manual when the email has submitted. In this phase, content provider's web domain and the username should be filled in the a form then we give a script to the content provider which has set the id like the Google Analytics. To let the content provider login to our administration site, password is required, we should ask the password in this phase. Since some content providers might not follow our process, we provide the support form in the bottom.

If the content provider doesn't finished the full process, we send a reminder, encouraging email to them.

### Registration of End User
We allow the end user leaves message on the board, but we defer the message and reminder the end user that the username and email are required to publish the message. A password setting email will be send to the end user to support message management. The published time is the time after the end user's registration.

On the other hand, we don't allow the end user adds tag to the image without registration because the tagging is an advanced operation in Ziltag. We don't need everyone tagging the image.

### Upgrade from End User to Content Provider
Since end user may want our plugin when they have the trial at other content provider's site, we should show an "apply to content provider" tip in our landing page to the visitor who logged as end user.
